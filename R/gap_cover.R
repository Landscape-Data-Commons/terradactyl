#' Calculate the number, length, and percent of gaps
#' @description Calculate the number, length, and percent of gaps by plot or line.
#' @param gap_tall Data frame. The format must match the output from
#' \code{\link{gather_gap}()} which includes at minimum the variables PrimaryKey,
#' LineKey, LineLengthAmount, RecType, and Gap.
#' @param tall Logical. If \code{FALSE} then the output will be a named list of
#' data frames, one for each type of indicator calculated: length of transects
#' in gaps, number of gaps, and percent of transects in gaps. If \code{TRUE}
#' then the output will be a single data frame with one record for each indicator
#' type for each gap size class for each plot (or transect on a plot depending
#' on the value of \code{by_line}). Defaults to \code{FALSE}.
#' @param breaks Numeric vector. These are the breaks between gap size classes
#' in centimeters. The smallest size class is inclusive on both sides, e.g. if
#' the lowest two values in \code{breaks} are 25 and 50 then gaps of 25 or 50 cm
#' would be included in the 25-50 class. Larger classes are inclusive only on the
#' high end, e.g. if \code{breaks} is \code{c(25, 50, 100, 200)} then a 50 cm gap
#' would be included in the 25-50 class and a 100 cm gap would be included in the
#' 51-100 class. Defaults to \code{c(20, 24, 50, 100, 200)} which produces the classes
#' 20-24, 25-50, 51-100, 101-201, and 200-Inf (with \code{no_max_cutoff = TRUE} which is the default).
#' @param type Character string. The type of measurement (perennial-only canopy,
#' all-plant canopy, or basal) to use. For perennial-only calculations, use
#' \code{"P"}, \code{"perennial"}, or \code{"perennial canopy"}. For all-plant use
#' \code{"C"} or \code{"canopy"}. For basal use \code{"B"} or \code{"basal"}.
#' Defaults to \code{"canopy"}.
#' @param no_max_cutoff Logical. If \code{TRUE} then the largest size class will
#' be defined from the largest finite value in \code{breaks} to infinity. If your
#' calculations need to be restricted to a maximum gap size, set this to
#' \code{FALSE} and make sure that \code{breaks} does not include \code{Inf}.
#' Defaults to \code{TRUE}.
#' @param by_line Logical. If \code{FALSE} then results will be calculated for
#' each value in the PrimaryKey variable. If \code{TRUE} then the results will
#' be calculated for each unique combination of values in PrimaryKey and LineKey.
#' Defaults to \code{FALSE}.
#' @returns If \code{tall} is \code{TRUE} then the output is a named list
#' (percent, n, and length) of data frames containing values for each type of
#' indicator. The data frames contain the identifying variable(s) and one variable
#' for each gap size class containing the relevant indicator value. if \code{tall}
#' is \code{FALSE} then the output is a single data frame containing the identifying
#' variable(s), a variable with the indicator type, a variable with the gap
#' size class, and a variable with the indicator value. In every case, if there
#' were gap size classes for which no data qualified the values will be 0.

  # going to be on the right EXCEPT in the case of the smallest gap class which
  # is inclusive on both sides. To deal with that, we'll just assign that class
  # to any gap smaller than the second break value and then use cut() on
  # everything else.
  # After we've got those assigned, we can split them into variables for the
  # minimum and maximum values in the class and adjust those to reflect the
  # inclusivity, e.g. if 50 is the minimum, then we'll change that to 51 because
  # it wasn't inclusive on the left.
