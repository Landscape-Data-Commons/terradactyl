Accumulated species presence, cover, and height across Line-point intercept, Vegetation height, and Species inventory methods.

# Get a list of all species occurring on a plot across methods (LPI, height, species inventory)
# This method also adds cover and height by species. Be aware that sample sizes may be insufficient to make an accurate estimate
