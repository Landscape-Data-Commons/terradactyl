\arguments{
\item{species_file}{Character string. The full file path (including file extension)
to the file containing the species list.}

\item{species_growth_habit_code}{Character. The field name for the growth habit
codes in the species file. Defaults to \code{"GrowthHabitSub"}}

\item{growth_habit_file}{Character string. The full file path (including file extension)
to the file containing the growth habit list. If NULL we assume the species list contains those values}

\item{growth_habit_code}{Character. The field name for the growth habit codes
in the growth habit file. Defaults to \code{"Code"}}

\item{species_code}{Character. The field name for the species codes in the species file.}

\item{species_duration}{Character. the field name for the Duration field in the species file.}

\item{dsn_tall}{The observed data datasource}

\item{species_list_file}{The file path to the species list. If the dsn contains the species list, then specify the layer within the dsn.}
