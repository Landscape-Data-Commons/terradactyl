\arguments{
\item{header}{Data frame or character string. The data to be provided as the argument \code{header} to any indicator calculation functions that require it. If this is a character string, it must point to the .Rdata file containing the data.}

\item{dsn}{Character string. The filepath to the geodatabase containing data. Passed to indicator calculation functions that require the argument \code{dsn}.}

\item{species_file}{Data frame or character string. The data to be provided as the argument \code{species_file} to any indicator calculation functions that require it. If this is a character string, it must point to the CSV or GDB file containing the data. This should almost always be to a geodatabase containing tblNationalPlants and tblStateSpecies.}

\item{lpi_tall}{Data frame or character string. The data to be provided as the argument \code{lpi_tall} to any indicator calculation functions that require it. If this is a character string, it must point to the .Rdata file containing the data.}

\item{gap_tall}{Data frame or character string. The data to be provided as the argument \code{gap_tall} to any indicator calculation functions that require it. If this is a character string, it must point to the .Rdata file containing the data.}

\item{height_tall}{Data frame or character string. The data to be provided as the argument \code{height_tall} to any indicator calculation functions that require it. If this is a character string, it must point to the .Rdata file containing the data.}

\item{spp_inventory_tall}{Data frame or character string. The data to be provided as the argument \code{spp_inventory_tall} to any indicator calculation functions that require it. If this is a character string, it must point to the .Rdata file containing the data.}

\item{soil_stability_tall}{Data frame or character string. The data to be provided as the argument \code{soil_stability_tall} to any indicator calculation functions that require it. If this is a character string, it must point to the .Rdata file containing the data.}

\item{...}{Optional are filtering statements. These will be passed to \code{dplyr::filter()} to applied to \code{header} to restrict the calculations.}

\item{generic_species_file}{Optional character string. Must specify the full path to a CSV containing generic species information. If this is \code{NULL}. Defaults to \code{NULL}.}

\item{verbose}{Logical. If \code{TRUE} the function will produce diagnostic
messages. Defaults to \code{FALSE}.}
}
\value{
A data frame with all standard TerrADat indicators in a format matching TerrADat.
}
\description{
A wrapper function for the *_calc() family of functions that produce the default TerrADat indicators.
