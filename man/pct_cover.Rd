\usage{
pct_cover(lpi_tall, tall = FALSE, hit = "any", by_year = FALSE,
  by_line = FALSE, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{lpi_tall}{A tall/long-format data frame. Use the data frame \code{"layers"} from the \code{gather.lpi()} output.}

\item{tall}{Logical. If \code{TRUE} then the returned data frame will be tall rather than wide and will not have observations for non-existent values e.g., if no data fell into a group on a plot, there will be no row for that group on that plot. Defaults to \code{FALSE}.}

\item{hit}{Character string. If \code{"any"} then percent cover will be calculated using any hit in the canopy column (so a single pin drop record may be counted more than once if it had hits that corresponded to different groups). If \code{"first"} then only the first canopy hit at a pin drop will be used to calculate cover.  If \code{"basal"}, then only the soil surfacy hit will be used to calculate cover. Defaults to \code{"any"}.}

\item{by_year}{Logical. If \code{TRUE} then results will be reported further grouped by year using the \code{DateModified} field from the data forms. Defaults to \code{FALSE}.}

\item{by_line}{Logical. If \code{TRUE} then results will be reported further grouped by line using the \code{LineID} and \code{LineKey} fields from the data forms. Defaults to \code{FALSE}.}

\item{...}{Optional character strings. One or more variable name from \code{lpi_tall} to calculate percent cover for, e.g. \code{"GrowthHabitSub"} to calculate percent cover by growth habits or \code{"GrowthHabitSub", "Duration"} to calculate percent cover for categories like perennial forbs, annual graminoids, etc.}

\description{
Calculate the percent cover by plot for variables or combinations of variables. Percent cover will be calculated for every combination of the variables requested, so if the variables are \code{GrowthHabitSub} and \code{Duration} then the output will contain fields like \code{Graminoid.Perennial}, \code{Graminoid.Annual}, \code{Shrub.Perennial}, etc. whereas using just the variable \code{code} will produce one column per species code. Any number of indicator variables can be used. These are calculated as cover from anywhere in the canopy column or as only the first hit in the canopy column. Any groupings where all the variable values were \code{NA} will be dropped.
