\usage{
gap_cover(
  gap_tall,
  tall = FALSE,
  breaks = c(20, 24, 50, 100, 200),
  type = "canopy",
  no_max_cutoff = TRUE,
  by_line = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{gap_tall}{Data frame. The format must match the output from
\code{\link{gather_gap}()} which includes at minimum the variables PrimaryKey,
LineKey, LineLengthAmount, RecType, and Gap.}

\item{tall}{Logical. If \code{FALSE} then the output will be a named list of
data frames, one for each type of indicator calculated: length of transects
in gaps, number of gaps, and percent of transects in gaps. If \code{TRUE}
then the output will be a single data frame with one record for each indicator
type for each gap size class for each plot (or transect on a plot depending
on the value of \code{by_line}). Defaults to \code{FALSE}.}

\item{breaks}{Numeric vector. These are the breaks between gap size classes
in centimeters. The smallest size class is inclusive on both sides, e.g. if
the lowest two values in \code{breaks} are 25 and 50 then gaps of 25 or 50 cm
would be included in the 25-50 class. Larger classes are inclusive only on the
high end, e.g. if \code{breaks} is \code{c(25, 50, 100, 200)} then a 50 cm gap
would be included in the 25-50 class and a 100 cm gap would be included in the
51-100 class. Defaults to \code{c(20, 24, 50, 100, 200)} which produces the classes
20-24, 25-50, 51-100, 101-201, and 200-Inf.}

\item{type}{Character string. The type of measurement (perennial-only canopy,
all-plant canopy, or basal) to use. For perennial-only calculations, use
\code{"P"}, \code{"perennial"}, or \code{"perennial canopy"}. For all-plant use
\code{"C"} or \code{"canopy"}. For basal use \code{"B"} or \code{"basal"}.
Defaults to \code{"canopy"}.}

\item{no_max_cutoff}{Logical. If \code{TRUE} then the largest size class will
be defined from the largest finite value in \code{breaks} to infinity. If your
calculations need to be restricted to a maximum gap size, set this to
\code{FALSE} and make sure that \code{breaks} does not include \code{Inf}.
Defaults to \code{TRUE}.}

\item{by_line}{Logical. If \code{FALSE} then results will be calculated for
each value in the PrimaryKey variable. If \code{TRUE} then the results will
be calculated for each unique combination of values in PrimaryKey and LineKey.
Defaults to \code{FALSE}.}
}
\value{
If \code{tall} is \code{TRUE} then the output is a named list
(percent, n, and length) of data frames containing values for each type of
indicator. The data frames contain the identifying variable(s) and one variable
for each gap size class containing the relevant indicator value. if \code{tall}
is \code{FALSE} then the output is a single data frame containing the identifying
variable(s), a variable with the indicator type, a variable with the gap
size class, and a variable with the indicator value. In every case, if there
were gap size classes for which no data qualified the values will be 0.
